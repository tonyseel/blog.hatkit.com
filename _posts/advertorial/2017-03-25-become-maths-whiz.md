Many people find mathematics daunting. If true, this piece is for you. If not, this piece is still for you.

What do you think of when you think about mathematics? Perhaps you think about x's and y's, intractable fractions, or nonsensical word problems. 

<b>I was trained as a mathematician, and I will let you in on a trade secret</b>: That is not what mathematics is, nor where it lives. It's true that learning mathematics often involves solving problems, but it should focus on the joy of solving puzzles, rather than memorizing rules.

And I'd like to introduce you to the man who once invited me to the study of problem solving: George Pólya.

## Math Pólya’s way 

For many reasons, not the least of which is that Pólya <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1985-09-08/news/mn-2892_1_polya-george-mathematician" target="_blank">died</a> in 1985, you will meet him as I did – through his wildly successful <a href="http://math.hawaii.edu/home/pdf/putnam/PolyaHowToSolveIt.pdf" target="_blank">'How to Solve It'</a>

Penned in 1945, this book went on to sell over one million copies and was translated into 17 languages.

Pólya's problem solving plan breaks down to four simple steps:

<a href="http://epltt.coe.uga.edu/index.php?title=Situated_Cognition" target="_blank">Here's a classic problem</a> from research on mathematics education done by Jean Lave. 

Jean Lave says it is important to visualize the problem in your head using pictures and then to carry out the plan.

New brain research validates what mathematics educators have been saying for decades: Pictures help us think. Drawing pictures also happens to be another of Pólya's suggestions.

I've taught mathematics, and how to teach mathematics, for nearly 30 years. 

For over a decade, it was my job to convince high school freshmen not only that algebra was meaningful, but that it was meant for them, and they for it. 

In my work, I've met many people who love mathematics and many who find it overwhelming and nonsensical. 

And so it's an important part of my work to help people see the beauty and wonder of mathematics, and think of themselves as mathematicians.

## Introducing Puzzle Buzz for Kids

Now <a href="https://education.uoregon.edu/users/jennifer-ruef" target="_blank">Jennifer Ruef</a>,Assistant Professor of Education Studies along with "Highlights Puzzle Buzz" has used Pólya's four step formula to create a puzzle book for kids in a more simpler manner. It has used the same methodologies Polya mentioned in the book "How to Solve It" to increase mathematical skills. <b>The book introduces various puzzles and mentions how to solve them using Pólya's four step process. </b>

This Puzzle Buzz activity books are packed with age-appropriate puzzles for kids, including: mazes, thinking puzzles, hidden pictures® puzzles, comparing, sequencing, letter sounds, concentration, creativity and logic.

Highlights Puzzle Buzz is offering these <a href="https://goo.gl/rM8JfJ">Puzzle Books</a> FREE of cost, perfect for kids who wants to increase their mathematical abilities.
