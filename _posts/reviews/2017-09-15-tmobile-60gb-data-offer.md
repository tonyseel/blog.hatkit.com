USA's biggest telecom service provider T-Mobile has announced a new plan offering users up to 60GB free LTE data for the next six month. This means 10GB data per month for a period of six months.

The free data offer is available to the company's prepaid users. It will come into force post the expiry of the ongoing T-Mobile's Monsoon offer. This complimentary 4G data is provided in partnership with Toluna Group, a leading provider of real-time digital consumer insights 13+ with 13 million members across 68 countries.

All the users who register with Toluna are eligible for the offer. Toluna is ranked as one of the Top 50 Most Innovative Market Research Firms on the Greenbook's 2014 GRIT Report. Only new users who register with Toluna after September 15 017 are eligible to avail the offer.

Here's how users can get free LTE data of 10GB per month:

1. Visit Toluna by clicking here.
2. Complete the 3 step registration process.
3. You will get an email after registration. 
4. Confirm your registration by clicking on the email link.
5. Login to the Toluna Site by entering your username and password.
6. Once logged in click on Internet Icon and you will be presented with T-Mobile.
7. Now follow the on screen banners to avail the offer.

Once done successfully, the 10GB free data will be credited into the user's account in 24 hours. Post this, T-Mobile will automatically add 10GB free data every month into the account.

The company claims that the offer is similar to its T-Mobile Monsoon offer, announced three months ago. Under the T-Mobile Monsoon offer, the company offered 10GB free data to Airtel Postpaid customers for downloading the T-Mobile android app. The validity of this offer, however, was only three months.

T-Mobile recently also announced its Postpaid Simple Choice scheme, under which the company offerred unlimited text messages and unlimited (2G) data in 140 countries around the world, at no extra cost.
