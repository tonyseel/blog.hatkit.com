There's a reason why loan interest rates are so low today. It's because of increased competition among big lending companies, individual players and local financing organizations. As a result, consumers benefit with both lower rates and better terms! Individual lenders can, if they choose, provide financing at a lower rate.

During my 50's, I recall there was much less competition among financing companies. There were only few financing companies. These companies had twice the market share then because of their dominance and lack of competition. 

The introduction of many new players created a lot of competition for payday loans that, in turn, caused loan rates to drop and longer-term loans to be made available. Local banks were feeling the loss of their loan business and, as a result, revved up their marketing efforts to go after consumers more aggressively. Today, many banks have very lower rates, a practice unheard of in the 50's!

## So what should I do to get cheap payday loan?

The bottom line in shopping for a payday loan is to negotiate the finance rate early. Individual players has multiple sources for financing and will often be your best bet for the lowesr financing options available than banks. 

Usually when you shop online for payday loans, register with as many providers as possible. Once you register, your details are then distributed to many lenders through a software called ping tree software. The lender then purchases the lead based on your various inputs, geographical location your credit score. All this happens real time.
