Tinder has been testing a new product for months and now it's been released. But if you're over 30, it's a whole more expensive to use. The new product is called Tinder Plus and it allows users to undo accidental left swipes and also search for people outside of their geolocation.

With the new added flexibility comes a price tag, though, but that price depends on what side of 30 you're on. If you're in your 20s, then you'll have to fork out $9.99 per month to access the new version. But if you're 30 or over, well get out your wallets because it'll set you back $19.99.

Well, Tinder can keep their 20-year-old, cashless candidates. These dating sites are just as good and they're free.

Cindy Matches is a unique matching tool comprised of three key factors that produce like-thinking and fruitful connections: Life, Freedom and Cultural Background. This online dating platform brings people together that are interested in similar activities, passions and future aspirations. Instead of having the user endlessly search for their best match, they send them a single personalized match each day by email. These introductions have been carefully selected based on the user's CM (Life, Freedom and CB) score.
