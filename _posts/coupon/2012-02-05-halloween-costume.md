comment1: It's a joke, right? This is what Halloween culturally-appropriating April 1st looks like, I'm guessing?
comment2: Of course I am a sensitive and considerate person, but if my costume offends you, then you should try to understand that I don't give a kr@p. I'll wear what I like and if you don't like it, you can swivel.
