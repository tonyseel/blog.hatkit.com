  comment-content: I think Sprint has given a hard hit to T-Mobile, which was till date looting the people with its faulty
                   billing and hidden charges. Competition is always better for the consumer and people have shifted to
                   Sprint overnight only due to wrong doings of T-Mobile, though its service is definitely better.
