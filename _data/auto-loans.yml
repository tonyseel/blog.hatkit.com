  comment-content: I have tried most online places and have been denied. I have been approved through 2 dealerships but they want 20-30% down. Any suggestions on what I should do.

  comment-content: Auto finance is what i do for a living and the loans that require this type of down payment are from lenders that charge the dealers anywhere from 20%-25% of the amount financed as a fee to take the loan. What the dealer is doing is asking you to put enough money down so they can pay the fees required to get a lender to buy your contract. After 7 1/2 years of doing sub-prime auto finance I can tell you that if this is the best approval that the dealer can get you have two options. First if you do not really need the car right now, work on improving your credit and try again in about 9-10 months. Second if you do need the car, suck it up and make the down payment, then make 12 payments as agreed and refinance.
