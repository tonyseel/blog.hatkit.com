  comment-content: If you are using a payday loan company, your credit must be bad. My advice ... don't renew it. If you don't renew it, they can't recharge you interest. Simply tell the person that you don't have the money, but that you really, really want to pay the loan off and that you take it seriously. Make regular payments WITHOUT renewing the loan. Payday loans don't send your account to collections for two or three weeks. Once collections calls, tell them that you are very sorry and that you are working really hard to pay the loan and when you can you will renew the loan. BUT DON'T RENEW THE LOAN until the loan is just under 2 months overdue ... but ALWAYS make payments down on the loan every week or two.
